      <h1>Routing in Histograms</h1>
      <p>
       This page provides the preliminary concepts required to understand the shortest-path routing scheme presented in the paper "Routing in Histograms." The algorithm allows a data packet to navigate between any two vertices in a histogram using minimal stored information.

  <h2>1. The Environment: Histograms and Visibility</h2>

<h4>Histogram Polygon (P)</h4>
<p>
  In this context, a histogram is a specific type of polygon with two key properties. First, it is <strong>orthogonal</strong>, meaning all its edges are either vertical or horizontal. Second, it is <strong>x-monotone</strong>, which means that any vertical line intersects the polygon at most twice. The top of the histogram is a single horizontal edge. The vertices of P are indexed in a counterclockwiser order from 0 to n-1 starting at the left base vertex.

<h4>R-Visibility and the Graph G(P)</h4>
<p>
  The connections between vertices are not standard straight lines. Instead, the algorithm uses <strong>rectilinear visibility (r-visibility)</strong>. Two vertices v and w are considered "co-visible" if the axis-aligned rectangle between them lies entirely within the histogram. The network of all such connections forms the <strong>r-visibility graph G(P)</strong>, which is the "map" our algorithm navigates.
</p>

<h2>2. Vertex Classification</h2>
<p>
  Every vertex in the histogram is classified based on its local geometry, which is crucial for routing decisions. Each vertex has two properties: its orientation (left/right) and its angle (convex/reflex).
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Left vs. Right Vertex:</strong> Every vertex is an endpoint of exactly one horizontal edge. If it is the <em>left</em> endpoint, it's a <strong>left vertex</strong>. Otherwise, it's a <strong>right vertex</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Convex vs. Reflex Vertex:</strong> If the interior angle at a vertex is 90° (π/2), it is <strong>convex</strong>. If the interior angle is 270° (3π/2), it is <strong>reflex</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives four combined types: <strong>l-convex, r-convex, l-reflex,</strong> and <strong>r-reflex</strong>.</p>

<h2>3. The Routing Scheme Components</h2>
<p>The routing scheme equips each vertex with minimal information to make smart, local decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Label lab(v):</strong> This is the unique address of a vertex v. It contains the vertex's index (vid) and, for reflex vertices and base vertices, the index of a special landmark called its "breakpoint" (br(v)). The label format is (vid, br(v)id) for reflex/base vertices.</li>
  <li><strong>Routing Table p(v):</strong> A tiny piece of stored data represented by a single bit indicating whether the left visible neighbor \( \ell(v) \) is higher or lower than the right visible neighbor r(v).</li>
  <li><strong>Link Table:</strong> At any given vertex, this is simply a list of the labels of all its directly connected neighbors (N(v)). The algorithm uses this table to identify its neighbors and check if the target is among them.</li>
  <li><strong>Stretch Factor:</strong> A measure of path quality. It's the ratio of the routing path's length to the true shortest path's length. This scheme achieves a stretch factor of 1, meaning it always finds the absolute shortest path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Visibility Landmarks</h2>
<p>The algorithm doesn't have a global map. Instead, it uses a set of local landmarks visible from the current vertex s to determine the next hop towards a target t.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Corresponding Vertex cv(v):</strong> The other vertex that shares the same horizontal edge as v.</li>
  <li><strong>Left/Right Bounding Vertices \( \ell(v) \) and r(v):</strong> From a vertex v, \( \ell(v) \) is the leftmost visible vertex closest to the base edge, and r(v) is defined analogously.</li>
  <li><strong>Interval I(s):</strong> The set of all vertices located horizontally between \( \ell(s) \) and r(s), defined as [\( \ell(s) \), r(s)]. A key first step in routing is to check if the target t is within the current interval I(s).</li>
  <li><strong>Near/Far Dominators nd(s, t) and fd(s, t):</strong> These are crucial when the target t is inside the current interval I(s) but not directly visible. Let's assume that <strong>s<sub>x</sub> &lt t<sub>x</sub></strong>, the other case is symmetric. The <strong>near dominator nd(s, t)</strong> is the rightmost neighbor of s that is to the left of t. The <strong>far dominator fd(s, t)</strong> is the leftmost neighbor of s that is to the right of t. These two vertices effectively "gate" the region containing the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Interval between Dominators I(s, t):</strong> This is a more specific interval, defined as [nd(s, t), fd(s, t)]. It contains all vertices that lie horizontally between the near and far dominators. When t is in I(s), the algorithm's next goal is to figure out how to get into this sub-interval.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakpoint br(v):</strong> This applies to reflex and base vertices and is a key part of the vertex label. For an r-reflex vertex or a left base vertex v, its breakpoint br(v) is the highest visible vertex to its right that is below it. Analogous definitions apply to l-reflex vertices and the right base vertex. This landmark essentially acts as an "escape route" from the pocket created by the reflex vertex.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Routing algorithm explanation</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of the algorithm is to find the shortest path from any vertex s to any vertex t using only local information. The routing uses rectilinear visibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Preprocessing</h3>
    At first, the algorithm needs to preprocess each vertex. Here is the preprocessed information:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Label lab(v): </strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>lab(v) = v<sub>id</sub>, if v is not a base vertex and a convex vertex</li>
        <li>lab(v) = (v<sub>id</sub>, br(v)<sub>id</sub>), if v is a base vertex or a reflex vertex</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Routing table p(v): </strong>a bit that says whether \( \ell(s) \) is higher than r(v) or not</li>
      <li><strong>Link table: </strong>a list of lables of all r-visible neighbors</li>
      <li><strong>Landmarks: </strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>cv(v): </strong>corresponding vertex (other endpoint of its horizontal edge)</li>
        <li><strong>\( \ell(v) \): </strong>leftmost visible vertex</li>
        <li><strong>r(v): </strong>rightmost visible vertex</li>
        <li><strong>br(v): </strong>breakpoint (only computed for reflex vertices and base vertices)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>if v is an r-reflex vertex or the left base vertex, br(v) is the left endpoint of the horizontal edge with the highest y coordinate to the right of and below v visible from v</li>
          <li>if v is an l-reflex vertex or the right base vertex, br(v) is the right endpoint of the horizontal edge with the highest y coordinate to the left of and below v visible from v</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routing algorithm</h3>
    The key concept in this algorithm is the interval I(s) = [\( \ell(s) \), r(s)]
    The question we ask ourselves is: "Is the target t inside I(s)?"

    <h4>Case 1: t is a neighbor of s</h4>
    Then go directly to t!

    <h4>Case 2: Target t is outside the interval I(s)</h4>
    That means the current vertex is inside a "pocket" of the histogram and we need to escape it. We do that by using the 1-bit routing table (made during the preprocessing):
    <ul>
      <li>If \( \ell(v) \) is higher → go to \( \ell(v) \)</li>
      <li>Else → go to r(s)</li>
    </ul>

    This guarantees that we climb towards the top of the histogram (and escape the pocket we were in).

    <h4>Case 3: Target t is inside the interval I(s) but not directly visible</h4>
    This is the most interesting case.

    Let's assume <strong>s<sub>x</sub> &lt t<sub>x</sub></strong>, the other case is symmetric. In this case, two special neighbors are computed:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Near dominator nd(s, t):</strong> the rightmost neighbor of s with x ≤ x(t)</li>
      <li><strong>Far dominator fd(s, t):</strong>the leftmost neighbor of s with x ≥ x(t)</li>
    </ul>

    The shortest path from s to t must go through either <strong>nd(s, t)</strong> or <strong>fd(s, t)</strong>. 

    To decide the next hop, we look at nd(s, t) and its breakpoint. The breakpoint b is already computed in the preprocessing since nd(s, t) is a reflex vertex. With the help of the breakpoint b, two "regions" are created:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>[nd(s, t), b]: </strong>If t lies in that interval, we choose nd(s, t) as the next hop.</li>
      <li><strong>[cv(b), fd(s, t)]: </strong>If t lies in that interval, we choose fd(s, t) as the next hop.</li>
    </ul>
